# **Act IV - The Lantern’s Truth**

## **Scene 1: The Deep Marsh**

The PC reaches the marsh’s core, a circular pool of still, black water.  
The fog here is _alive_, swirling in slow spirals.  
Blue lights drift beneath the surface like trapped stars.

**Kael is here**, suspended in the water, unconscious but unharmed.  
The marsh is holding him as a “bright memory”, a high‑value payment.

>[!note] **DM Note:**  
Kael is not drowning. The marsh is preserving him, albeit poorly, as a bargaining chip.

---

# **Scene 2: The Marsh Guardian Awakens**

When the PC approaches the pool, the Lantern flares violently.  
The water rises, forming the shape of the **Marsh Guardian**, the spirit bound inside the Lantern.

### **What the PC Learns**

- The Guardian was once the marsh’s protector
- Seren bound it to stop the flood
- The Lantern is the prison
- The Guardian is furious, starving, and desperate
- The marsh is collecting memories because the Guardian cannot

### **Guardian’s Attitude**

- Angry at being bound
- Resentful of Seren
- Curious about the PC
- Protective of Kael, but only as leverage

---

# **Scene 3: The Confrontation**

You choose the tone, but all paths revolve around **Kael’s rescue** and the **Lantern’s fate**.

---

## **Option A — Combat Finale (CR 3–4)**

The Guardian manifests as a swirling elemental of water, fog, and memory‑light.

**Combat Goals:**

- It tries to keep the PC away from the pool
- It uses illusions of the PC’s past to distract them
- It attempts to drain memories instead of dealing lethal damage

**Kael’s Rescue:**  
The PC must reach the pool and pull Kael free (Strength or Athletics check, DC 13).  
Doing so weakens the Guardian for one round.

**Victory Condition:**  
Reduce the Guardian to 0 HP or force it back into the Lantern.

---

## **Option B — Social Finale (Negotiation)**

The Guardian speaks through the fog, its voice layered with dozens of memories.

### **What It Wants**

- Freedom
- Revenge on Seren
- Release from the Lantern
- A new bargain

### **What the PC Can Offer**

- Their own memories (small sacrifice)
- A promise to carry the Lantern
- A new pact with the marsh
- A ritual to rebind the Guardian with fairer terms

**Kael’s Rescue:**  
The Guardian will release Kael if the PC offers something of value.

**Skill Challenge (DC 14–16):**

- Persuasion to calm the Guardian
- Arcana to understand the Lantern’s binding
- Insight to read its true desires
- Religion/Nature to propose a new pact

Success means Kael is freed and the Guardian accepts new terms.

Failure means the Guardian lashes out, leading to combat or a forced choice.

---

## **Option C — Moral Dilemma Finale**

The Guardian forces the PC to choose one of three outcomes:

### **1. Free the Guardian**

- Kael is released immediately
- The marsh floods the village within days
- The Guardian leaves, furious but unbound
- Seren collapses, her life tied to the Lantern’s magic

### **2. Keep the Guardian Bound**

- Kael is released
- The illusions continue
- The marsh remains hungry
- Seren begs the PC not to choose this
- The PC becomes the new Lantern Keeper (slow memory loss over time)

### **3. Rebind the Guardian with New Terms**

Requires a **high‑stakes ritual**:

**Skill Challenge (5 successes before 3 failures):**

- Arcana (DC 15): Stabilize the Lantern
- Insight (DC 14): Understand the Guardian’s emotional core
- Persuasion (DC 15): Offer a fair pact
- Nature (DC 14): Appease the marsh
- Constitution Save (DC 13): Resist memory drain
- Strength (DC 12): Pull Kael free mid‑ritual

**Success:**

- Kael is saved
- The Guardian becomes a reluctant ally 
- The marsh calms
- The Lantern becomes a **safe**, weakened magic item
- Seren survives, though fragile

**Failure:**

- The Guardian breaks free
- The marsh surges
- The PC must flee with Kael
- Seren is lost to the fog

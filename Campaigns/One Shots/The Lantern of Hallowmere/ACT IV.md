# The Lantern’s Truth

The Lantern is powered by a trapped spirit, the **Marsh Guardian**, who is furious at being bound.

**Final Confrontation Options**
You choose the tone:

- **Combat:** The Guardian manifests as a CR 3–4 elemental
- **Social:** The Guardian demands 

- **Moral Dilemma:**
- Free the Guardian (the marsh floods the village)
- Keep it bound (the illusions continue)
- Rebind it with new terms (requires a high‑stakes skill challenge)

**Ending Variants**
- The village is saved but changed
- The marsh becomes a haunted zone
- The Lantern becomes the PC’s new magic item
- Seren becomes an ally… or a tragic casualty

### Lore & Roleplay 
**The Burden of Guilt:** Years ago, during a desperate famine, **Elira** was the one who authorized **Seren Hollow** to find "unconventional" ways to save the village's crops. She knew **Seren** was tampering with the Marsh Guardian's essence, but she looked the other way because the village was starving. Now that the Lantern is tearing reality apart, **Elira** is paralyzed by the fear that if the truth comes out, the village will hang her, or worse, the Guardian will claim her first.

**Personality Traits:**
- "I speak plainly. If you want flowery prose, go to the theater."
- "I trust a sharpened blade more than a signed treaty."

**Flaws:** 
* She is deeply suspicious of outsiders and assumes every traveler is a potential threat to her people.

**Cues:**
- **The Tell:** She constantly polishes her signet ring when lying.
- **The Hook:** She hires the PC not just to "stop the lights," but to potentially save Seren.
- **The Nervousness:** She insists on lanterns being lit at midday because "The shadows in this town have started growing teeth."

### Appearance
**Elira Vance** carries herself with the rigid, watchful posture of a scout who never truly left the field. Her **half-elven heritage** is most apparent in her sharp, high cheekbones and ears that taper to subtle, elegant points, though any "fey grace" is buried under the practical grit of a frontier leader.

- **Face & Hair:** Her face is weathered by sun and stress, featuring a narrow jaw and a faint, jagged scar that bisects her left eyebrow. She wears her steel-gray hair pulled back into a **severe, tight braid** that reaches between her shoulder blades, ensuring not a single strand obscures her vision. Her eyes, the color of flint, are perpetually narrowed, as if she is constantly measuring the distance to the nearest exit.

- **Attire:** Eschewing mayoral finery, **Elira** wears **dark, supple leather coat** over a high-collared tunic of muted purple. The leather is well-oiled and silent, showing signs of frequent repair. A heavy, functional leather belt cinches her waist, supporting her shortsword and a ring of heavy iron keys that clink softly when she moves.

**Defining Features:**
- **The Signet Ring:** On her right hand, she wears a heavy silver ring bearing the crest of Hallowmere. It is noticeably shinier than the rest of her gear, polished to a mirror finish by her nervous habit of rubbing it with her thumb.

- **The Boots:** Her heavy, calf-high traveling boots are caked with the dark, peaty mud of the marshes, a sign that she spends more time patrolling the town’s perimeter than sitting behind a desk.

- **The Longbow:** When she is outside her office, her **Masterwork Longbow** is slung across her back, the faint elven runes etched into the wood catching the light with a dull, silvery sheen.

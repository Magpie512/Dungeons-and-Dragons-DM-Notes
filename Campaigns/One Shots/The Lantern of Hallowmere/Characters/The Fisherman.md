### **Lore & Roleplay**

**Background:**  
Draius “Old Bram” Bram is a retired fisherman who has lived in Hallowmere his entire life. He was one of the first to see the Marsh Lights return and has been terrified ever since. He drinks to sleep, mutters about debts and collectors, and avoids the water at all costs. Despite his fear, he genuinely wants to help the PC but struggles to articulate what he knows.

**Roleplay Notes:**

- Voice shaky, often slurred
- Repeats warnings: “Don’t look at the lights… don’t follow ’em…”
- Flinches at sudden sounds
- Knows more than he realizes; memories surface when he’s emotional
- Treats the marsh like a living thing that can hear him

### **Appearance**

A wiry, weather‑beaten man in his late fifties with sunken eyes and a patchy beard.  
His clothes smell of brine and old ale.  
His hands shake constantly, whether from fear or drink.  
He carries his lantern everywhere, even in daylight.

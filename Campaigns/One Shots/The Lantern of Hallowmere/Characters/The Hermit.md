### **Actions**

**Faltering Cantrip (At Will)**  
Seren casts a weakened magical effect (choose: _gust_, _thaumaturgy_, or _minor illusion_).  
The spell flickers or distorts due to her memory loss.

**Desperate Push (1/day)**  
Seren releases a burst of unstable marsh‑magic.  
One creature within 10 ft must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom save or take 1d6 psychic damage and be pushed 5 ft away.

---

### **Reactions**

**Instinctive Flinch**  
When a creature moves within 5 ft of Seren, she may impose disadvantage on one attack against her as illusions flicker defensively.

---

### **Special Abilities**

**Fraying Memory**  
Seren has disadvantage on Intelligence checks to recall personal details.  
When she casts a spell, roll a d4. On a 1, she forgets what she was doing and the spell fizzles.

**Lantern‑Touched**  
While within 20 ft of the Lantern, Seren sheds dim blue light and gains resistance to psychic damage.  
If she moves more than 20 ft away, she takes 1 psychic damage per round as the bond strains.

**Keeper’s Burden**  
Seren can sense disturbances in the fog. She automatically knows when the marsh is “hungry” or when a memory is being taken nearby.

### **Traits**

**Senses:** Blindsight 30 ft (fog‑enhanced), Passive Perception 13  
**Languages:** Common, Druidic fragments, Old Hollow dialect  
**Damage Resistances:** Psychic (while near the Lantern)

### **Inventory**

- The **Lantern** (unstable, memory‑burning artifact)
- Lavender bundles and half‑burned candles
- Driftwood runes carved with marsh‑binding sigils
- A journal missing several pages
- A charm she made for Elira years ago (she no longer remembers crafting it)

### **Lore & Roleplay**

**Background:**  
Seren Hollow is the last surviving member of the Hollow line, the family that once bargained with the marsh to save Hallowmere from a catastrophic flood. When the ritual failed, the Lantern was created, binding the Marsh Guardian and replacing the flood with a fog that eats memory. Seren has spent years feeding the Lantern with her own mind to keep the village safe. She is exhausted, frightened, and unraveling, but still clings to the belief that she can protect others.

**Roleplay Notes:**

- Speaks softly, often mid‑sentence forgetting what she was saying
- Repeats certain phrases like anchors: “Hold the light… hold the light…”
- Flinches at sudden movement or loud noise
- Treats the Lantern like a living creature
- Alternates between pleading for help and insisting she must bear the burden alone

---

### **Appearance**

A thin, pale woman in her late thirties with tangled dark hair streaked with white.  
Her eyes glow faintly blue in the fog, and her hands shake constantly.  
Her clothes are patched, water‑stained, and covered in runic chalk marks.  
She looks like someone who has not slept properly in years.

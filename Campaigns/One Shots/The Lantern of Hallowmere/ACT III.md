# **Act III - The Lantern Keeper**

## **Scene 1: The Heart of the Marsh**

The PC reaches the deepest part of the marsh, a place where the fog is thick enough to feel like cloth and the air hums with memory‑magic.

- The ground is unstable, half‑solid, half‑water.
- Blue lights drift in slow spirals, watching rather than attacking.
- The Lantern reacts: warm, then cold, then flickering.

>[!note] **DM Note:**  
This area is the marsh’s “mouth”, where it collects the strongest memories.

## **Scene 2: Seren Hollow Revealed**

The half‑sunken shack is Seren’s refuge and prison.  
She has been holding the marsh’s hunger back for years, and it shows.

### **Seren’s State**

- Exhausted, half‑starved, sleep‑deprived
- Surrounded by runes, lavender bundles, and half‑burned candles
- The Lantern is brighter here, almost too bright
- Seren’s memories are fraying; she repeats phrases, forgets names, loses track of time

### **Seren’s Personality (Reframed)**

- **Not evil** - she’s been paying the debt alone
- **Desperate** - she knows she can’t hold the marsh back anymore
- **Guilty** - she believes Kael’s disappearance is her fault
- **Terrified** - not of the marsh, but of what she might become if she loses herself completely

## **Scene 3: The Truth of the Lantern**

The Lantern is not a tool - it is a **burden**, a **role**, and a **contract**.

### **What the PC Can Learn (Arcana / Insight)**

- The Lantern burns **memory**, not oil
- It can repel the marsh, but only if fed
- Seren has been feeding it with her own memories for years
- The Lantern Keeper is the one who stands between the marsh and the town
- Seren is nearly spent - she cannot keep going

**DC Suggestions:**

- **Arcana (DC 14):** Understand the Lantern’s function
- **Insight (DC 12):** Realize Seren is close to losing herself
- **Arcana (DC 16):** Learn that the Lantern can be passed to another
- **Insight (DC 15):** Seren is afraid the Lantern will consume the next Keeper

## **Scene 4: Seren’s Reaction (Roleplay Options)**

Depending on the PC’s approach, Seren responds differently.

### **If the PC is gentle / empathetic**

- Seren begs for help
- She asks the PC to take the Lantern
- She warns them about the cost
- She apologizes for Kael, believing she failed him

### **If the PC is aggressive / accusatory**

- Seren becomes defensive
- She insists she “saved the town”
- She warns the PC to leave before the marsh notices them
- She may lash out magically if cornered

### **If the PC tries to take the Lantern by force**

- Seren panics
- The Lantern flares
- Illusions surge uncontrollably
- Combat may begin, but Seren fights to **escape**, not kill

---

## **Scene 5: The Choice**

This is the emotional core of Act III.

### **Option A - Take the Lantern**

The PC becomes the new Lantern Keeper.

**Consequences:**

- The Lantern bonds to them
- They gain protection from the marsh
- They begin paying the debt (small memory losses over time)
- Seren collapses, freed but empty, or dies peacefully

### **Option B - Help Seren Reinforce the Boundary**

A ritual requiring:

- The Lantern
- A Signficant amount of the PC’s memory
- Seren’s remaining strength

**Outcome:**

- The marsh is pushed back temporarily
- Kael’s location becomes clear
- Seren survives but is drastically weakened
- The PC earns her trust

### **Option C - Reject the Lantern**

The marsh reacts violently.

**Outcome:**

- The fog thickens and a maelstrom forms outside. The core of this madness is close.
- Wisps swarm
- Seren breaks down, believing she has doomed the town
- Combat or escape sequence leading into [[ACT IV]]

## **Marsh‑Salt Charm**
*Wondrous item (uncommon), no attunement*

**Description:**  
A small linen pouch filled with pale grey salt harvested from the Hollow Acre before it was claimed by the marsh. The salt is always slightly warm to the touch, and faint blue grains glow when wisps are near. Villagers once carried these charms as tokens of protection, though few remain.

### **Lore**
These charms were crafted by Seren Hollow during the early years of the fog's march onto Hallowmere. They don’t stop the marsh’s hunger, but they confuse its manifestations by masking the bearer’s emotional and mental “scent.” 

The only remaining charm made by Seren before she went missing.

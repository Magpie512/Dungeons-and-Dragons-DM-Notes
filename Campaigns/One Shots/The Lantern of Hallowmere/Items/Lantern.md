## **The Hallowmere Lantern (Vessel of the Reluctant Guardian)**
*Wondrous item (Rare), requires attunement*

**Description:** This heavy, verdigris, stained bronze lantern contains a flickering blue flame that pulses like a slow heartbeat. The glass is etched with runes of binding that seem to weep cold condensation, and the air around the lantern smells of damp earth and stagnant water. When held, you can feel a faint, rhythmic thrumming against your palm, as if something inside is pacing a very small cell.

### **Properties**
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Attunement:** Yes (requires a period of meditation to sync your memories with the spirit within)

---

### **Passive Effects:**
**Sight of the Marsh:** 
While holding the lit lantern, you have advantage on saving throws against illusions and on Wisdom (Insight) checks to discern if a creature is lying.  

**The Guardian’s Ward:** You and any creatures within 10 feet of the lantern cannot be tracked by non, magical means, as a thin, clinging fog obscures your footprints.

### **Active Abilities**

**Pierce the Veil.** 
*Action.* - The lantern flares with a brilliant, silver, blue light. For 1 minute, you gain true sight out to a range of 30 feet.  
- Once used, this ability cannot be used again until long rest.  

- **Memory Flash.** 
- *Reaction.* - When a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can force the Guardian to project a distracting, bittersweet memory into their mind.  
	
	* The attacker must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on the attack.  
	* You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses at dusk.

### **Drawbacks or Curses**
- **The Toll of Remembrance:** The Guardian is weakened but still hungry. Every time you use the **Pierce the Veil** ability, you must roll a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you lose a minor, non,essential memory, such as the name of a childhood pet or the taste of your favorite meal.  

- **Heavy Burden:** If the lantern is ever more than 100 feet away from you for more than an hour, you suffer one level of exhaustion as the spirit’s tether pulls at your own life force.

### **Lore**
Forged by Seren to contain a flood that would have swallowed Hallowmere, the lantern was once a prison of absolute silence. Following the confrontation in the Deep Marsh, the binding was rewritten. It is no longer a cage of punishment, but a pact of shared burden. The spirit inside is now a weary traveler, bound to the PC's journey, watching the world through the glass with a mixture of resentment and curiosity.

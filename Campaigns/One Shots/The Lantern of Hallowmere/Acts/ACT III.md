# **Act III - The Lantern Keeper (Revised to Encourage Rejection)**

## **Scene 1: The Heart of the Marsh**

The PC reaches the deepest part of the marsh, a place where the fog is thick enough to feel like cloth and the air hums with memory‑magic.

- The ground is unstable, half‑solid, half‑water
- Blue lights drift in slow spirals, watching rather than attacking
- The Lantern reacts: warm, then cold, then flickering
- **When the PC gets close, the Lantern emits a sharp, painful pulse**

> [!note] **DM Note:**  
> This area is the marsh’s “mouth”, where it collects the strongest memories.  
> The Lantern becomes erratic here, hinting that it is **dangerous to hold**.

---

## **Scene 2: Seren Hollow Revealed**

The half‑sunken shack is Seren’s refuge and prison.  
She has been holding the marsh’s hunger back for years, and it shows.

### **Seren’s State**

- Exhausted, half‑starved, sleep‑deprived
- Surrounded by runes, lavender bundles, and half‑burned candles
- The Lantern is brighter here, almost too bright
- Seren’s memories are fraying; she repeats phrases, forgets names, loses track of time
- **She cannot remember Kael’s name, only that “a child is missing”**
- **She sometimes forgets who the PC is mid‑conversation**

### **Seren’s Personality (Reframed)**

- Not evil
- Desperate
- Guilty
- Terrified
- **Unstable and unpredictable**
- **Clearly damaged by the Lantern’s burden**

---

## **Scene 3: The Truth of the Lantern**

The Lantern is not a tool. It is a **burden**, a **role**, and a **contract** created by a ritual that failed. It stopped a flood but replaced it with a fog that eats memory.

### **What the PC Can Learn (Arcana / Insight)**

- The Lantern burns **memory**, not oil
- It can repel the marsh’s fog, but only if fed
- Seren has been feeding it with her own memories for years
- The Lantern Keeper stands between the marsh and the town
- Seren is nearly spent
- **The Lantern is unstable in the marsh’s core**
- **Taking it here risks immediate backlash from the Guardian**

**DC Suggestions:**

- Arcana (DC 14): Understand the Lantern’s function
- Insight (DC 12): Realize Seren is close to losing herself
- Arcana (DC 16): Learn the Lantern can be passed to another
- Insight (DC 15): Notice Seren’s fear that the Lantern will consume the next Keeper **even faster**

> [!note] **DM Note:**  
> Every clue should imply that **taking the Lantern is a trap**, not a solution.

## **Scene 4: Seren’s Reaction (Roleplay Options)**

Depending on the PC’s approach, Seren responds differently.

### **If the PC is gentle / empathetic**

- Seren begs for help
- She asks the PC to take the Lantern
- She warns them about the cost
- She apologizes for Kael
- **Her desperation makes the Lantern feel unsafe to accept**
- **Dialogue cue:**  
    _“Please… take it… before it takes the rest of me. I can’t remember my own mother’s face anymore.”_

### **If the PC is aggressive / accusatory**

- Seren becomes defensive
- She insists she “saved the town”
- She warns the PC to leave
- She may lash out magically
- **Her instability reinforces that the Lantern is dangerous**
- **Dialogue cue:**  
    _“You think you can handle it? You don’t know what it eats.”_

### **If the PC tries to take the Lantern by force**

- Seren panics
- The Lantern flares violently
- Illusions surge uncontrollably
- Combat may begin
- **The Lantern reacts like a living thing resisting the PC**
- **Environmental cue:**  
    The fog around the PC tightens like a fist, and the Lantern emits a shrill, painful hum.

## **Scene 5: The Choice (Reframed to Encourage Rejection)**

This is the emotional core of Act III.

### **Option A - Take the Lantern**

The PC becomes the new Lantern Keeper.

**Consequences (emphasize danger):**

- The Lantern bonds painfully
- The PC immediately loses a small memory
- The Guardian stirs violently
- Seren collapses
- **The marsh reacts with hostility**
- **Environmental cue:**  
    The fog lashes out like a living creature, sensing a new Keeper.

>[!note] DM Note
This option should feel like a **bad idea**.

---

### **Option B - Help Seren Reinforce the Boundary**

A ritual requiring:

- The Lantern
- A significant amount of the PC’s memory
- Seren’s remaining strength

**Outcome (emphasize cost):**

- The marsh is pushed back only briefly
- Kael’s location becomes clear
- Seren survives but is drastically weakened
- **The PC loses something important**
- **The Lantern becomes even more unstable**
- **Environmental cue:**  
    The runes flicker violently, and the Lantern sputters like a dying heart.

>[!note] DM Note
This option should feel like a **temporary, costly patch**.

---

### **Option C - Reject the Lantern**

**This is the option the story pushes toward.**

The marsh reacts violently, but not maliciously.  
It is simply responding to the Lantern’s refusal.

**Outcome (emphasize urgency, not punishment):**

- The fog thickens and a maelstrom forms outside
- Wisps swarm
- Seren breaks down, believing she has doomed the town
- The Guardian’s presence becomes undeniable
- **The PC is forced into action, leading directly into Act IV**
- **Rejecting the Lantern becomes the only path that keeps the PC whole**

>[!note] DM Note
**Dialogue cue from Seren:**  
_“If you won’t take it… then the marsh will come for both of us.”_
>
**Environmental cue:**  
The Lantern dims, then flares, then dims again, like a dying star.

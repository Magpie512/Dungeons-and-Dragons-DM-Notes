# **Act I - Arrival in Hallowmere**

## **Scene 1: The Threshold of Fog**

As the player approaches, the transition from the “outside world” to the marshland should feel _wrong_, like crossing into a place that you shouldn't be.

>[!note] ## **Environmental Hooks**
>- **The Sensory Hook:**  
 >    The air grows cold and tastes faintly of salt, peat, and something metallic, like blood diluted in water. Even though it is midday, the sun is a pale, sickly disc behind a veil of fog that seems to breathe.
 >  * **The Visual:**  
> 	Every house has a lantern lit on the porch, but the glass is painted blue or green. The villagers believe these colors confuse the **Marsh Lights**, the drifting souls the marsh uses to collect its “due.”

- **Initial Interaction:**  
    At the village gate, they meet **Old Bram**. He isn’t just drunk; he’s terrified. His lantern sputters as he tries to light it with shaking hands.
    
    - **Dialogue:**  
        _“Don’t look at the lights, stranger. They ain’t ghosts… they’re collectors. They take what the marsh is owed. Little bits o’ you, piece by piece.”_

Bram won’t explain what the marsh is “owed.” He mutters that “the debt’s come due again.”

## **Scene 2: Audience with Mayor Vance**

The Mayor’s office is in the “High House,” one of the only stone buildings in town. It smells of lavender, coming from the numerous scented candles lit across the estate.

- **The Secret:**  
    Elira Vance didn’t just hire the PC because she’s scared; she’s terrified because she knows **why** the lights have returned.  
    Years ago, she begged **Seren Hollow** to stop a catastrophic flood. It is said in whispers that Seren bargained with the marsh, offering her family’s land, the Hollow Acre, in exchange for the waters receding.
	
	She never returned but neither did the threat of the flood.
	
	Whatever magic that caused the marsh's fog has been altered. Something's changed and the marsh is now marching towards the town of Hallowmere.
    
    Nobody knows Seren was the reason the flood stopped. They also don't know she might be in danger. Elira has hidden this truth for years from the general populace.
    
- **The Skill Challenge:**
    
    - **Insight (DC 13):**  
        The PC notices **Elira** clutching a small charm. She claims it’s for “good luck,” but she’s lying.  
        It’s the last remaining **Marsh-Salt Charm** **Seren** made before vanishing.
        
    - **Persuasion (DC 15):**  
        Elira reveals that the missing child, **Kael**, was last seen following a “blue light” toward the Old Weeping Willow, a place where the marsh’s presence is strongest.  
        She pales when she says this, because she knows children have the brightest memories… and the marsh is hungry.

>[!note] 
>If the PC agrees to investigate the marsh and genuinely wants to help out of kindness, Elira hesitates, then offers the **Salt-Marsh Charm**. She frames it as a practical precaution, but it’s clear she’s reluctant to part with it. It’s the last thing she has from Seren.
>* **Offering the Charm**
>
> If the PC agrees to investigate the marsh or prepares to leave the High House, Elira hesitates, then offers the **Marsh‑Salt Charm**. She frames it as a practical precaution, but it’s clear she’s reluctant to part with it,  it’s the last thing she has from Seren.
>
> - **Elira’s tone:** trying to stay authoritative, but strained
> - **Reason given:** *“It may help you if the lights come close.”*
> - **Subtext:** she’s giving up something deeply personal because the situation is dire
>
> **DM Note:**  
> Elira only gives the charm if the PC shows genuine intent to help or succeeds on the Persuasion check. If the PC fails the check, she still considers offering it, but only after a moment of visible internal conflict.

## **Scene 3: The Investigation**

Let the player choose their path. Each location reveals a different facet of the marsh’s debt.

| **Location**          | **What They Find**                                                                                    | **Skill Check**                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Docks**         | Fresh water‑logged footprints that end abruptly at the edge. The mud pulses faintly, as if breathing. | **Investigation (DC 12):** The mud is “Living Ooze,” a byproduct of marsh‑magic. It reacts to strong memories,  it quivers more when the PC thinks of something emotional. |
| **The Town Square**   | Little Tessa playing with a “light.” But there is no light,  just a shimmer in the air.               | **Perception (DC 14):** Tessa isn’t talking to a light; she’s whispering to an empty space that smells like ozone and wet stone. The marsh is trying to lure her.          |
| **The General Store** | The shopkeeper is frantic; all the oil and candles are sold out.                                      | **Intimidation (DC 11):** He admits he saw Seren Hollow buying strange salts a week ago, the last ingredients she needed to reinforce the weakening boundary.              |

Each clue points to the same truth:  
**Seren was trying to keep the marsh’s hunger at bay… and she failed.**

## **Scene 4: The “First” Manifestation (The Hook)**

As the PC prepares to head into the marsh, the fog thickens, not naturally, but purposefully.

1. **The Event:**  
    The fog rises in a sudden wave, swallowing the path. The PC can’t see their own feet. The air hums with a low, watery vibration.
    
2. **The Illusion:**  
    A figure from the PC’s backstory appears, someone they lost, someone tied to a powerful memory.  
    The marsh is testing them, tasting their identity.
    
3. **The Twist:**  
    The figure points toward the marsh and whispers:  
    _“It’s cold in the deep, [Player Name]. The debt is never paid.”_
    
4. **The Combat/Action:**  
    Two **Reflections** (use _Shadow_ stats, but describe them as shimmering, watery versions of the PC) emerge.  
    **They don’t want to kill**, they want to **drag the PC toward the marsh**, where the fog can take more from them.
    

This is the marsh’s first attempt to “collect.”

## **DM Tips for This Act**

- **The “Kael” Hook:**  
    If your player is motivated by heroism, have Tessa give the PC Kael’s favorite toy, a wooden fish.  
    The toy feels **warm** when pointed toward the North Marsh.  
    This isn’t magic; it’s the marsh reacting to Kael’s bright, unspent memories.
    
- **Tone Guidance:**  
    Every villager is living under a debt they don’t fully understand.  
    Some fear Seren.  
    Some blame Elira.  
    None realize the marsh doesn’t care about guilt, only balance.

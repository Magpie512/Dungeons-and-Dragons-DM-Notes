### **Traits**
**False Appearance** While the Blight remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a pool of stagnant water or a wet stone.

**Legendary Resistance (1/Day)** If the Blight fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Corrosive Form** A creature that touches the Blight or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet takes 4 (1d8) acid damage. Nonmagical metal weapons that hit it take a permanent -1 penalty to damage rolls (destroyed at -5).

### **Actions**
**Pseudopod Slam** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage. If the target is wearing nonmagical metal armor, its AC takes a permanent -1 penalty (destroyed if AC drops to 10).

### **Legendary Actions**
The Bog-Blight can take 1 legendary action at the end of the player's turn:

* **Sticky Surface.** The Blight expands its surface area. The ground within 5 feet of the Blight becomes **Difficult Terrain** until the start of its next turn.
* **Amorphous Shift.** The Blight moves up to half its speed through mud or water without provoking opportunity attacks.

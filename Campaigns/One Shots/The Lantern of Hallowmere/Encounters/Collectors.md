## **Traits**

### **Fog‑Bound Form.**

The Debt Collector can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If it ends its turn inside a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom save or lose a fragment of memory, suffering disadvantage on its next attack roll or ability check.

### **Memory Scent.**

The wisp can sense strong emotions and memories. It has advantage on attack rolls against creatures who are frightened, charmed, or who failed a Wisdom save in the last minute.

### **Illusory Lure.**

As a bonus action, the wisp creates a faint illusion of a familiar voice or silhouette from the target’s past within 10 feet of itself. A creature that sees or hears the illusion must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom save or be compelled to move up to 10 feet toward the illusion.

### **Marsh‑Tethered.**

If reduced to 0 hit points, the wisp dissolves into fog and reforms at 1 hit point at the start of its next turn unless it is inside magical light or the Lantern Keeper’s lantern aura.

_Melee Spell Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.

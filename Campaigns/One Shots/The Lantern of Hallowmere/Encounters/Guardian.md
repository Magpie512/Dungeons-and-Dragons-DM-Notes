### **Traits**

**Bound Essence.**  
The Guardian is tethered to the Lantern. When reduced to 0 hit points, it is drawn back into the Lantern instead of dying.

**Fog Form.**  
The Guardian can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 3 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Fading Memory Aura.**  
Creatures that start their turn within 5 feet of the Guardian must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom save or take 3 (1d6) psychic damage.

**Illusory Flicker.**  
Once per turn, the Guardian can create a brief illusion (a voice or silhouette). The next Wisdom save a creature makes against the Guardian is made with disadvantage.

### **Actions**

**Tide Lash**  
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
**Hit:** 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.  
If the target is within 5 feet of water, it must succeed on a DC 11 Strength save or be pulled 5 feet toward the Guardian.

**Mind Ripple.**  
*Ranged Spell Attack:* +4 to hit, range 20 ft., one target.  
**Hit:** 6 (1d8 + 2) psychic damage.  
On a failed DC 11 Wisdom save, the target has disadvantage on its next attack roll.

**Call of the Shallows (Recharge 5 – 6).**  
Each creature of the Guardian’s choice within 10 feet must make a DC 12 Wisdom save or be charmed until the end of its next turn.  
While charmed, a creature’s speed is halved.

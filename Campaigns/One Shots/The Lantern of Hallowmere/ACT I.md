## Act I — Arrival in Hallowmere

### Scene 1: The Threshold of Fog

As the player approaches, the transition from the "outside world" to the marshland should feel physical.

- **The Sensory Hook:** The air grows cold and tastes of salt and decay. Even though it is midday, the sun is a pale, sickly disc.

- **The Visual:** Every house has a lantern lit on the porch, but the glass is painted blue or green, a folk superstition to ward off "The Drowned."

- **Initial Interaction:** At the village gate, they meet **Old Bram**. He isn’t just drunk; he’s terrified. He’s trying to light a lantern with shaking hands.
    
    - **Dialogue:** _"Don't look 'em in the eye, stranger. The lights don't just show you things... they take things. Pieces of your mind."_

### Scene 2: Audience with Mayor Vance

The Mayor’s office is in the "High House," the only stone building in town. It smells of lavender to mask the scent of the marsh.

- **The Secret:** Elira Vance didn't just hire the PC because she's scared; she’s scared because she knows **why** the lights are back. Years ago, the village "sacrificed" land to the marsh to save the town from a flood, land that belonged to Seren Hollow’s family.

- **The Skill Challenge:**
    
    - **Insight (DC 13):** The PC notices Elira clutching a small, rusted key. If pressed, she claims it’s for the town records, but she’s lying (it’s the key to Seren’s old family cellar).
    
    - **Persuasion (DC 15):** She reveals that the missing child, **Kael**, was last seen following a "blue light" toward the Old Weeping Willow.

### Scene 3: The Investigation

Allow the player to choose their path. Provide three distinct locations to investigate:

|**Location**|**What They Find**|**Skill Check**|
|---|---|---|
|**The Docks**|Fresh water-logged footprints that end abruptly.|**Investigation (DC 12):** The mud is "Living Ooze"—it pulses slightly when touched.|
|**The Town Square**|Little Tessa playing with a "light."|**Perception (DC 14):** Tessa isn't talking to a light; she's whispering to an empty space that smells like ozone.|
|**The General Store**|The shopkeeper is frantic; all the oil and candles are sold out.|**Intimidation (DC 11):** He admits he saw Seren Hollow buying strange salts a week ago.|

### Scene 4: The "First" Manifestation (The Hook)

As the PC prepares to head into the marsh, the Lantern’s power flares.

1. **The Event:** The fog thickens until the PC can't see their own feet.
    
2. **The Illusion:** The PC sees someone from their own backstory standing in the mist, someone they lost or failed.
    
3. **The Twist:** The figure points toward the marsh and whispers: _"It’s cold in the deep, [Player Name]. Why did you let the light go out?"_
    
4. **The Combat/Action:** Two **Reflections** (use _Shadow_ stats, but they look like shimmering, watery versions of the PC) attack. They don't want to kill; they want to pull the PC toward the marsh edge.

## DM Tips for this Act:

- **The "Kael" Hook:** If your player is more motivated by heroism, have Tessa give the PC Kael’s favorite toy (a wooden fish). Tell the player the toy feels _warm_ when they point it toward the North Marsh.

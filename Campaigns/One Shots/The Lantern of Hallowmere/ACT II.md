# Into the Marsh

The marsh is eerie, quiet, and full of illusions.

**Encounters (choose 1–2):**

- **Illusory Will‑o’-Wisps**  
    They lure the PC toward deep water. They’re illusions, but failing a save causes psychic damage.
- **Marsh Beast (CR 1–2)**  
    A reflavored crocodile, or ooze.
- **Memory Echo**  
    The lantern’s magic manifests a scene from the PC’s past.  
    _This is where you can tailor the adventure to your player character._

**Key Discovery**

The PC finds:
- A half‑sunken shack
- Strange runes carved into driftwood
- A journal page describing **“the Lantern Keeper”**

# **Act II - Into the Marsh **

The marsh is not just eerie, it is _aware_.  
Every ripple, every whisper of fog, every flicker of blue light is the marsh testing the PC’s identity, tasting their memories, and deciding whether they are worth “collecting.”

>[!important] ## **Atmosphere of the Marsh**
>As the PC steps off the solid path and into the wetlands:
>
> - The fog thickens unnaturally, curling around their ankles like fingers.
> - Sounds are muffled, as if the marsh is swallowing them.
> - The air smells of wet stone, lavender, and something old — like a forgotten room being opened.
> - Shapes drift in the mist, never fully forming.

## **Encounters (Choose Either)**

Each encounter should feel like the marsh probing the PC’s mind, searching for memories to take.

### **1. Illusory Will‑o’-Wisps (Debt Collectors)**

These aren’t true creatures, they’re **manifestations of the marsh’s hunger**.

- They drift just out of reach, mimicking voices the PC recognizes.
- They lure the PC toward deep water or unstable ground.
- They vanish if struck, but failing a Wisdom save deals **psychic damage** as the marsh “tastes” a memory.

**Flavor:**  
When the PC takes psychic damage, describe a memory flickering, a name forgotten for a moment, a face blurred, a childhood detail slipping away.

It returns… but weaker.

### **2. Marsh Beast **

A physical threat, but still tied to the marsh’s magic.

Utilize From Encounters
* [[Crocodile]]
* [[Ooze]]

**Twist:**  
When the creature dies, its body dissolves into fog, the marsh reclaiming its borrowed form.

### **3. Memory Echo (Lantern Trigger)**

The lantern reacts to the marsh’s pressure and manifests a **Memory Echo**, a scene from the PC’s past.

This is your chance to tailor the story to the player.

Examples:

- A lost loved one calling their name
- A moment of failure replaying
- A childhood home half‑submerged in marsh water
- A mentor or rival appearing in the fog

**Purpose:**  
The marsh is trying to understand the PC’s identity so it can decide what to take.

**Mechanics:**  
A Wisdom save prevents psychic damage.  
Failing the save causes the PC to momentarily forget something minor, a detail from their backstory, a name, a smell, a place.

It returns after a short rest, but the momentary loss is unsettling.

## **Key Discovery, The Hollow Shack**

Eventually, the PC finds a **half‑sunken shack** at the edge of a deeper pool.  
This is **Seren Hollow’s last working site**, where she performed the rituals that kept the marsh’s hunger at bay.

### **What the PC Finds**

#### **1. The Shack**

- The roof has collapsed inward.
- Lavender bundles hang from the rafters, half‑rotted.
- The air is thick with fog that doesn’t disperse.
- A faint blue glow pulses beneath the floorboards.

This is where Seren tried, and failed, to reinforce the boundary.

---

#### **2. Strange Runes Carved into Driftwood**

These runes are **marsh‑binding sigils**, part of the original pact.

A successful Arcana or Religion check reveals:

- They are meant to **redirect** the marsh’s hunger.
- They are incomplete, Seren was interrupted.
- The runes are carved in a mixture of old Hollow family script and symbols representing **memory**, **identity**, and **debt**.

If the PC touches them, the fog reacts, a cold shock, like a hand gripping their mind.

---

#### **3. A Journal Page**

Water‑damaged but legible.  
It describes **“the Lantern Keeper.”**

### **Journal Fragment (Flavor Text)**

> _“The marsh remembers every bargain.  
> The debt must be paid.  
> If I cannot hold the boundary, someone must take the lantern.  
> The Keeper stands between the marsh and the town.  
> The lantern burns memory instead of oil.  
> May the next bearer be stronger than I.”_

This is the first hint that **Seren intended to pass the lantern to someone else**, possibly the PC.

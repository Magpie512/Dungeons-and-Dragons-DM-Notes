**What to Expect:**  
A mystery adventure focused on exploration, atmospheric tension, and uncovering the truth behind a cursed marsh. The player will navigate illusions, confront a desperate mage, and face a bound spirit demanding payment. Their final choice determines the fate of a missing child, the village, and the marsh itself.

---

Strange blue lights drift through the fog‑choked village of Hallowmere, appearing at odd hours and whispering to those who wander too close. The villagers speak in hushed tones of old bargains and debts long forgotten, and a missing child has left the town on edge. As the player investigates, they uncover signs of a deeper magic tied to the marsh itself, a magic that twists memories, shapes illusions, and hungers for something only the living can provide.

Their search leads them into the heart of the marsh, where a reclusive mage struggles to hold back forces she no longer fully understands. The truth behind the lights, the fog, and the strange Lantern she guards is older than the village and far more dangerous than superstition. As the boundary between memory and reality thins, the player must decide how far they are willing to go to protect Hallowmere from what stirs beneath the water.

In the end, the marsh will demand a choice, and the fate of the village will rest on what the player is willing to sacrifice.

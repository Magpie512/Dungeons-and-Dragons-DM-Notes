| Players | Level | Playtime |
| ------- | ----- | -------- |
| One     | 3-4   | 2-3      |
Strange lights have begun appearing in the fog‑choked village of Hollowmere. People whisper that the spirits of the drowned marsh‑folk have returned. The player is hired to investigate, but the truth is far stranger: a magical lantern is tearing open memories and illusions, and someone is using it for their own ends.

# ACT I — Arrival in Hollowmere

**Scene 1: The Fog‑Draped Village**

The player arrives to find:
- Lanterns burning at midday
- Villagers whispering
- A missing child (optional emotional hook)
- A frightened mayor who hires the PC

**Skill moments:**
- Perception to notice villagers avoiding eye contact
- Insight to sense the mayor is hiding something
- Investigation to find traces of marsh‑mud in the streets

**NPCs to use:**

# ACT II — Into the Marsh

The marsh is eerie, quiet, and full of illusions.

**Encounters (choose 1–2):**

- **Illusory Will‑o’-Wisps**  
    They lure the PC toward deep water. They’re illusions, but failing a save causes psychic damage.
- **Marsh Beast (CR 1–2)**  
    A reflavored crocodile, or ooze.
- **Memory Echo**  
    The lantern’s magic manifests a scene from the PC’s past.  
    _This is where you can tailor the adventure to your player character._

**Key Discovery**

The PC finds:
- A half‑sunken shack
- Strange runes carved into driftwood
- A journal page describing **“the Lantern Keeper”**
# ACT III — The Lantern Keeper

The shack belongs to **Seren Hollow**, a hermit‑mage who discovered the Lantern.

**Seren’s Personality**
- Not evil, but desperate
- Believes the Lantern can “fix” the past
- Terrified of losing control of the illusions

**Roleplay Options**
- Seren begs for help
- Seren tries to scare the PC away
- Seren attacks if cornered

**Skill Spotlight**
- Arcana to understand the Lantern
- Persuasion/Intimidation to influence Seren

# ACT IV — The Lantern’s Truth

The Lantern is powered by a trapped spirit, the **Marsh Guardian**, who is furious at being bound.

**Final Confrontation Options**
You choose the tone:

- **Combat:** The Guardian manifests as a CR 3–4 elemental
- **Social:** The Guardian demands 

- **Moral Dilemma:**

- Rebind it with new terms (requires a high‑stakes skill challenge)

**Ending Variants**

- The marsh becomes a haunted zone
- The Lantern becomes the PC’s new magic item
- Seren becomes an ally… or a tragic casualty
